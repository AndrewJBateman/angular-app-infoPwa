# AngularAppInfoPwa

This project gets information from a public API and displays it. A service-worker is used to make this a Progressive Web Application (PWA). This runs in the browser and managing data caching so API info is still displayed in the event of loss of network. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.4.

This project was started with a Gary Simon youtube tutorial to learn the basics of creating a pwa but it will be greatly expanded.

## To Do

-Update CSS to present info better.
-Change to reference a new API with more useful data and display more fields.
